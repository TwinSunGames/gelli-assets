You were about to take a bite...

Ghosty the Toast: Hey man, that's not cool.

Ghosty the Toast: Hey! Who says I belong to anybody? Huh?

Gelli: What? It talks?

Ghosty: Of course I talk! I'm a person, too!

TALK:

Ghosty: Talk? About what?

About the Shop

About Ghosty

About Toasty

Nothing (Nothing takes you back to the choices.)

ABOUT THE SHOP:

Ghosty: Well, I decided I would set up a ski shop in a snowy area so people could ski in the next area.

Gelli: I get to ski in the next area?

Ghosty: Yeah, in fact, that's the only way to get farther. You can't enter the level unless you have skis.

Gelli: Yeah right, this is just a scam that you use to get people to buy your skis!

Ghosty: No, I swear, you need them to progress... Just try to enter the level without skis.

ABOUT GHOSTY:

Ghosty: You want to know about me?

Ghosty: Well, I was just a normal peice of bread. But then I fell into a toaster!

Ghosty: For some reason all bread gets toasted eventually.

Ghosty: Um, yeah, so that's how I became a toast.

ABOUT TOASTY:

Ghosty: Toasty...?

Ghosty: Oh yeah, I think I remember that ghost. they're purple, right? Big toast fan?

Ghosty: Yeah, we're best friends. I haven't seen them in a while, though.

LEAVE:

Ghosty: See ya.
